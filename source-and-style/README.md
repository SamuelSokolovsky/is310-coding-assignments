The wesite I used was the Digital Public Library and specifically the Beginning of the American Red Cross source set. The link for the site is https://dp.la/primary-source-sets/beginnings-of-the-american-red-cross. I chose this because I have a passion for medicine and it seemed very interesting. The code was made in HTML and I found a couple of .js files, .jpg files, and some ,svg files which I am unfamiliar with. All the photos are attached below.
