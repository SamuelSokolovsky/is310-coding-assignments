I chose to scrape data from the Marvel database because I am a big amrvel fan and thsi is something that interests me. It also provides deatils about the characters, storylines, and comic book issues. I chose to gather the names and url's of all the characters from the characters' page. This can help researchers analyze the appearance, popularity, and any other trends across marvel comics.

According to the terms of service and the database (https://marvel.fandom.com/robots.txt) scraping the site is allowed as long as it follows the websites guidelines.

The scraped data will be saved in a CSV file called `marvel_characters.csv`, containing character names and their URLs.
